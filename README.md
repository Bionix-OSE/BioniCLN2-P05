# A research on Hyperspectral Fruit Ripeness detection using Deep Learning  
This fork of **Cognitive Systems Research Group**'s work at Tuebingen University (Germany) is for a small project in my class where we try to learn and repoduce what they did to build a model that can measure a fruit's ripeness using its hyperspectral image data. 
Due to limited time and scope of knowledge, files that we won't need are stripped out, and we will only focus on training on Mangos (as opposed to the paper's Avocado and Kiwi) and getting the model to recognize on potentially a different dataset.
